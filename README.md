# MDMDirector

MDMDirector is an opinionated orchestrator for [MicroMDM](https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm). It enables profiles to be managed with MicroMDM in a stateful manner, via a RESTful API. It also allows for installation of packages either just at enrollment or immediately. It receives webhook events from MicroMDM and then instructs MicroMDM to perform appropriate actions. As such, MDMDirector does not need to be exposed to the public internet.

## Usage

MDMDirector is a compiled binary and is configured using flags.

Requirements:

* Redis for the scheduled checkin queue
* PostgreSQL database for storing device information
* (Recommended) Signing certificate for signing profiles
* (STRONGLY recommended) Load balancer/proxy to serve and terminate TLS for MDMDirector


### MicroMDM Setup

You must set the `-command-webhook-url` flag on MicroMDM to the URL of your MDMDirector instance (with the addition of `/webhook`).

```
-command-webhook-url=https://mdmdirector.company.com/webhook
```

### Flags

- `-db-host string` - **(Required)** Hostname or IP of the PostgreSQL instance
- `-db-max-connections int` - Maximum number of database connections (default 100)
- `-db-name string` - **(Required)** Name of the database to connect to.
- `-db-password string` - **(Required)** Password of the DB user.

- `-escrowurl` - HTTP(S) endpoint to escrow erase and unlock PINs to ([Crypt](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt-server) and other compatible servers).
- `info-request-interval` - The amount of time in minutes to wait before requesting `DeviceInfo`, `ProfileList`, `SecurityInfo` etc. Defaults to 360.
- `-key-password string` - Password to decrypt the signing key or p12 file.
- `-loglevel string` - Log level. One of debug, info, warn, error (default "warn")
- `-logformat-format` - Log format. Either `logfmt` (the default) or `json`.
- `-micromdmapikey string` - **(Required)** MicroMDM Server API Key.
- `-micromdmurl string` - **(Required)** MicroMDM Server URL.
- `-once-in` - Number of minutes to wait before queuing an additional command for any device which already has commands queued. Defaults to 60. Ignored and overridden as 2 (minutes) if --debug is passed.
- `-password string` - **(Required)** Password used for basic authentication
